This is an analysis of data about animal intake and outprocessing rates at the Bloomington Animal Care and Control facility.  The facility makes their data available in .csv format.  I used Python and Pandas to clean and process the data; I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to make the charts.  I then used Bootstrap and .css to deploy a simple web site on github.io.
