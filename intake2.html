       <p>Dogs and cats make up the two largest population blocks in this facility. This is fairly predictable, given that these are the two most common household pet types. </p>
       <p>Cats actually outnumber dogs, which can be surprising to some, as third party animal rescue/adoption efforts for dogs can have a higher profile in some areas. This can give the perception that there are more dogs in shelters, when really there are just more groups trying to rescue them.</p>
